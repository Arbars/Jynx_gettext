		// - This is an on-going process.  The emulation runs in "bursts", each burst mixes sound samples for an
		//   entire sound buffer (it fits *precisely*).  In fact, with sound enabled, the host's sound provision
		//   TIMES the entire emulation!
		// - During a burst the Lynx may NEVER write to its speaker port to change the value of it's 6-bit DAC, so
		//   the previous known value would be "drawn" across the entire sound buffer (flat line).
		// - Otherwise, when the Lynx writes the 6-bit DAC register, we use the Z80 cycle counter to work out WHEN
		//   (in real time) it would have been written, and the output waveform in the sound buffer must reflect that.
		// - Bear in mind that a Z80 cycle MAY overshoot by a microscopic amount because the instructions are
		//   variable length.  The remainder reduces the length of the next cycle.  This COULD cause sound buffer
		//   "drawing" issues (ie: overrun array), but I handle this.
