Typing on the Lynx works.  Test all keys as follows:
Start over:

[L][ ] Without having pressed the host CAPS key since Lynx reset:
    And without holding SHIFT:

	PC	  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 - = BACKSPACE
	LYNX	  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 - : (delete)

	PC	q w e r t y u i o p [  ] ENTER
	LYNX	Q W E R T Y U I O P [  ] (RETURN)

	PC	        a s d f g h j k l ; '
	LYNX	        A S D F G H J K L ; @

	PC	           z x c v b n m , . /
	LYNX	           Z X C V B N M , . /

	PC	   SPACE
	LYNX       (space)

[L][ ] Without having pressed the host CAPS key since Lynx reset:
    And *holding* SHIFT:

	PC	  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 - = BACKSPACE
	LYNX	  ! " # $ % & ' ( ) _ = * (delete)

	PC	q w e r t y u i o p  [  ]   ENTER
	LYNX	q w e r t y u i o p  (C C) (RETURN)

[L][ ] Tick "Display | Use square pixels".  See that guest pixels are forced square, and display is centred.
[L][ ]   Resize host window and see that guest display size "snaps" to keep pixels square.
[L][ ]   If host window is too small, guest display disappears altogether on Linux, or remains on Windows.  [TODO: Sort out the difference]

[L][ ] Tick "Display | Fit to window".  See that guest image has its aspect ratio maintained at all times,
    but is increased to fill as much of the host window as possible.  This means black strips at top and
    bottom, or black strips at left and right.

[L][ ] Tick "Display | Fill Window".  See guest screen image fills the whole of the host area.
[L][ ]   Stretch host to wide or tall configuration, see guest image precisely fills this space,
         and no black areas are visible at all.

[ ][ ] No parameters just starts the program.
[ ][ ] Use green screen to show that the program can be re-started and is restoring settings from the master settings file.

The "--settings" allows specification of a settings file to use.  The next lexeme is the full path, enclosed in quotes if needed.

[ ][ ]    A settings file used in this manner should always be saved over automatically by Jynx on exiting!  [Use gedit to check]
       On Linux:     ../ForLinux/bin/Debug/Jynx --settings /home/jonathan/Documents/Jynx/Testing/test.config
       On Windows:   c:\users\jonathan\documents\work\jynx\ForWindows\Debug\Jynx.exe --settings "c:\users\jonathan\documents\work\jynx\Testing\test.config"

[ ][ ]    If --settings and --games are both present, the settings file should NEVER be saved over on exit.  This supports Hyperspin.
       On Linux:     ../ForLinux/bin/Debug/Jynx --games --settings /home/jonathan/Documents/Jynx/Testing/test.config
       On Windows:   c:\users\jonathan\documents\work\jynx\ForWindows\Debug\Jynx.exe --games --settings "c:\users\jonathan\documents\work\jynx\Testing\test.config"

[ ][ ] The "--snapshot" allows auto-starting a snapshot.  The next lexeme is the full path, enclosed in quotes if needed.
       On Linux:     ../ForLinux/bin/Debug/Jynx --snapshot /home/jonathan/Documents/Jynx/Testing/DuringBACH.lynxsnapshot
       On Windows:   c:\users\jonathan\documents\work\jynx\ForWindows\Debug\Jynx.exe --snapshot "c:\users\jonathan\documents\work\jynx\Testing\DuringBACH.lynxsnapshot"

[ ][ ] The "--snapshot" reports a clean failure, and exits the emulator, if a non-snapshot is passed in.
       On Linux:     ../ForLinux/bin/Debug/Jynx --snapshot /home/jonathan/Documents/Jynx/Testing/Nonsense.lynxsnapshot
       On Windows:   c:\users\jonathan\documents\work\jynx\ForWindows\Debug\Jynx.exe --snapshot "c:\users\jonathan\documents\work\jynx\Testing\Nonsense.lynxsnapshot"

[ ][ ] The "--tap" allows auto-running a TAP file.  The next lexeme is the full path, enclosed in quotes if needed.
       On Linux:     ../ForLinux/bin/Debug/Jynx --run "/home/jonathan/Documents/Jynx/Testing/ALL PAPERS.tap"
       On Windows:   c:\users\jonathan\documents\work\jynx\ForWindows\Debug\Jynx.exe --run "c:\users\jonathan\documents\work\jynx\Testing\ALL PAPERS.tap"

[ ][ ] The "--tap" reports a clean failure, and exits the emulator, if a non-tap is passed in.
       On Linux:     ../ForLinux/bin/Debug/Jynx --run "/home/jonathan/Documents/Jynx/Testing/Nonsense.tap"
       On Windows:   c:\users\jonathan\documents\work\jynx\ForWindows\Debug\Jynx.exe --run "c:\users\jonathan\documents\work\jynx\Testing\nonsense.tap"
			[MS-windows failed with ABORT called -- exception not caught properly]

[ ][ ] "--snapshot" takes precedence over "--run" if both are present.
       On Linux:     ../ForLinux/bin/Debug/Jynx --run "/home/jonathan/Documents/Jynx/Testing/ALL PAPERS.tap" --snapshot /home/jonathan/Documents/Jynx/Testing/DuringBACH.lynxsnapshot
       On Windows:   c:\users\jonathan\documents\work\jynx\ForWindows\Debug\Jynx.exe --run "c:\users\jonathan\documents\work\jynx\Testing\ALL PAPERS.tap" --snapshot "c:\users\jonathan\documents\work\jynx\Testing\DuringBACH.lynxsnapshot"

The "--games" command line switch will suppress the following prompts.
       On Linux:     ../ForLinux/bin/Debug/Jynx --games
       On Windows:   c:\users\jonathan\documents\work\jynx\ForWindows\Debug\Jynx.exe --games
[ ][ ] The   "Are you sure you want to close the Lynx emulator?"   prompt is never shown, and is forced to YES.
[ ][ ] The   "Tape rewound."   message is never displayed.  The tape is re-wound quietly.
[ ][ ] The   "This action will RESET the emulator!\n\nDo you wish to proceed?"   message is never displayed, and the default is taken to be YES.
